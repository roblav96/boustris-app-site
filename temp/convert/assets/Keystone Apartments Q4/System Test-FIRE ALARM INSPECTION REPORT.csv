GENERAL NOTATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS ,,,,,,,,
"All ADA panels are currently not supervised for power loss, opens, and ground faults. This item should be highly considered for repair due to the existing audio visual condition installed by previous (2) Contractors.",,,,,,,,
"All existing initiating circuits are class B type wiring. Special note shall be made that any trouble conditions that come in on these loops should be addressed immediately, due to the possibility that if this type of existing wiring is compromised, all devices down stream will not receive voltage and are therefore inoperable.",,,,,,,,
